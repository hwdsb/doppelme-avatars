DoppelMe avatars integration with BuddyPress.

This plugin completely replaces the upload avatar functionality within a BuddyPress community with the Doppelme Avatar creator.

Once you have these, place this in your wp-config.php file with the partner ID and Key
define( 'BP_DOPPELME_PARTNER_ID',  'XXX' );
define( 'BP_DOPPELME_PARTNER_KEY', 'XXX' );
